## This is a work in progress... come back soon!


## Under The Hood

The application uses a MySQL database to store the burger data and Node.js as the backend.  Express is used as the application server, Handlebars as the web template system and Sequelize as the ORM.  Below is a list of all Node packages used:

* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [method-override](https://www.npmjs.com/package/method-override)
* [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)
* [path](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html)
* [sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize)

## Error Handling

Empty burger names are not allowed.
